Mobile weather app made with react and expo using Openweather API

Built a cross-platform weather app using React and Expo, integrating features like weather forecasts, location search, and data fetching from the OpenWeather API.
Testing:

    Unit Testing: Tested individual components to ensure proper functionality:
        Forecast Component: Verified accurate rendering of weather data (e.g., day, icon, temperature).
        Refresh Component: Ensured the refresh button triggered the appropriate callback function.
        Search Component: Tested input handling, query submission, and clearing of search fields.
    Error Handling Tests: Simulated invalid location queries, ensuring alerts were displayed for user feedback.
    Integration Testing: Validated proper rendering of weather data, including location details and temperature, in the main weather component.
    Used Jest and React Testing Library for comprehensive testing and debugging.
